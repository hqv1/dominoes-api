# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    #branches: [ main ]
    branches:
      - '**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
